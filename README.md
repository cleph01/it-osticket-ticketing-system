# osTicket on Azure: Help Desk Support Ticketing

This project demonstrates the end-to-end deployment and practical application of osTicket, a leading open-source ticketing system. 

The installation process involves configuring Internet Information Services (IIS) as the web server, deploying PHP, and setting up a MySQL database server.

Beyond the deployment, this project details the configuration of osTicket's core features, including ticket categorization, workflow automation, and user management. 

The project culminates by working through realistic mock ticket scenarios, from creation to resolution, and providing hands-on experience in managing the ticket lifecycle.
