# Ticket Lifecycle Examples (Working Tickets)

This section provides practical, real-world-like examples of how support tickets are managed within the configured osTicket system. 

It walks through the complete lifecycle of several mock tickets, demonstrating key interactions such as ticket creation by end-users, routing and assignment to agents, agent responses and internal notes, status updates, and eventual ticket closure. 

These examples serve to illustrate the implemented configurations in action, showcasing the system's workflow automation and the agent's role in effectively addressing and resolving support requests.
