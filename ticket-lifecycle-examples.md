# Ticket Lifecycle Examples (Working Tickets)

This lab focuses on simulating real-world ticket interactions from both the end-user and help desk agent perspectives.

It walks through the complete lifecycle of several mock tickets, demonstrating key interactions such as ticket creation by end-users, routing and assignment to agents, agent responses and internal notes, status updates, and eventual ticket closure.
